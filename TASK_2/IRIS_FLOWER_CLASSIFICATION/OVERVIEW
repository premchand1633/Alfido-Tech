Dataset: Contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 iris flowers, categorized into three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica.

Objective: Classify iris flowers into their correct species based on their feature measurements.

Features: Four numerical features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).

Model Selection: Various algorithms (e.g., k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, logistic regression) can be used.

Training and Validation: The dataset is divided into training and validation sets for model training and evaluation.

Evaluation Metrics: Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Interpretation: Iris flower classification is a simple and interpretable problem, making it useful for learning machine learning principles.

Deployment: The model can be used in real-world applications for automated iris species classification, such as in botanical research or horticulture.
